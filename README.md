# ZAP 2022 Problem Sets

This repository contains solutions to the problem sets for the course **Základy algoritmizácie a programovania (ZAP)** from the academic year 2022. The assignments are based on the official problem sets published at [https://kurzy.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/zap/problemsets/](https://kurzy.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/zap/problemsets/).

## Repository Structure
Each folder (`ps1`, `ps2`, ..., `ps7`) contains the source code and documentation for a specific problem set. The root of the repository also contains a summary markdown file for each set, describing the goals, tasks, and instructions for running the solutions.

### Problem Set Summaries
- [Problem Set 1: Karel the Robot](ps1/ps1.md)
- [Problem Set 2: Numbers, Arrays](ps2/ps2.md)
- [Problem Set 3: Hangman](ps3/ps3.md)
- [Problem Set 4: Ball Sort Puzzle](ps4/ps4.md)
- [Problem Set 5: QR Code](ps5/ps5.md)
- [Problem Set 6: Curses](ps6/ps6.md)
- [Problem Set 7: Files](ps7/ps7.md)

## About
- All solutions were created as part of coursework for ZAP 2022.
- Each problem set demonstrates different programming concepts, such as algorithms, arrays, file handling, ncurses graphics, and more.
- For details on each assignment, see the linked markdown files above or visit the [official problem sets page](https://kurzy.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/zap/problemsets/).
